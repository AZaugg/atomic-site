    %h2 Trusted Distributions, Atomic Updates
    %p

      An Atomic Host is a lean operating system designed to run Docker
      containers, built from upstream CentOS, Fedora, or Red Hat Enterprise
      Linux RPMs. It provides all the benefits of the upstream distribution, plus
      the ability to perform atomic upgrades and rollbacks &mdash; giving the best
      of both worlds: A modern update model from a Linux distribution you know
      and trust.

    %h2 Secure Production Containers
    %p

      Running containers in production systems demands strong safeguards &mdash; especially
      in multi-tenant environments. Atomic Hosts use SELinux to protect and
      confine Docker containers with strict mandatory access control inside Linux
      Container namespaces.

    %h2 Portable and Scalable
    %p

      Docker containers can easily move across environments &mdash; from a developers laptop to
      a production host, or even across operating systems. Atomic hosts include Kubernetes for 
      orchestration and management of containerized application deployments, across a large cluster
      of container hosts.

    %h2 Unified Management from Containers to the OS
    %p

      Containers are elastic and dynamic, and you need management that
      is just as dynamic. Atomic includes a preview of Cockpit, a new
      administration tool Linux serves via a Web browser.  Cockpit allows
      admins to manage storage, services, and inspect journals
      straight from the browser. Cockpit also allows you to directly 
      inspect your containers and images. Atomic also makes it easy to 
      integrate your existing monitoring infrastructure in privileged 
      containers.
